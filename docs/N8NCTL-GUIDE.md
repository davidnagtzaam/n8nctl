## Installation

`n8nctl` is automatically installed with the n8nctl project.

### Make It Globally Available (Optional)

```bash
# Create symlink in /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /opt/n8nctl/scripts/n8nctl /usr/local/bin/n8nctl

# Now run from anywhere
n8nctl status
```

n8nctl backup

# Run health checks
n8nctl health
```

## Commands Reference

### Service Management

#### `n8nctl status`
Display current status of all services.

```bash
n8nctl status
```

**Output**: Shows running containers, their status, and ports.

---

---

### Scaling

#### `n8nctl scale <count>`
Scale the number of worker containers.

```bash
# Scale to 3 workers
n8nctl scale 3

# Scale to 1 worker (reduce)
n8nctl scale 1

# Scale to 10 workers (heavy load)
n8nctl scale 10
```

**What are workers?**
- Background processes that execute workflows
- More workers = more parallel workflow executions
- Each worker consumes ~200-500MB RAM

**When to scale up**:
- High workflow volume
- Many concurrent executions
- Complex, long-running workflows

**When to scale down**:
- Low usage periods
- Resource constraints
- Cost optimization

**Recommendation**:
- Start with 2-3 workers
- Monitor execution queue
- Scale based on actual usage

---

```bash
# Shell in main app (default)
n8nctl shell

# Shell in specific service
n8nctl shell n8n-web
n8nctl shell n8n-worker
n8nctl shell postgres
```

**Use cases**:
- Debugging container issues
- Inspecting files
- Manual database queries
- Testing configurations

**Exit shell**: Type `exit` or press Ctrl+D

---

#### `n8nctl exec <service> <command>`

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Problem**: `bash: n8nctl: command not found`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run with full path
/opt/n8nctl/scripts/n8nctl status

# Or create alias
echo 'alias n8nctl="/opt/n8nctl/scripts/n8nctl"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Or symlink to system path
sudo ln -s /opt/n8nctl/scripts/n8nctl /usr/local/bin/n8nctl
```

---

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: `Permission denied` when running commands

**Solution**:
```bash
# n8nctl needs sudo for Docker commands
sudo n8nctl status

# Or add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

---

### Services Won't Stop

**Problem**: `n8nctl stop` hangs or fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Force stop
sudo docker compose -f /opt/n8nctl/compose.yaml down -t 30

# If still hanging, force kill
sudo docker compose -f /opt/n8nctl/compose.yaml kill
```

---

### Backup Fails

**Problem**: Backup creation fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /tmp

# Check permissions
ls -la /tmp

# Check if database is accessible
n8nctl exec postgres pg_isready

# Try manual backup
sudo docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U n8n n8n > /tmp/manual-backup.sql
```
